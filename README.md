# PubliCV
## One website for each job seeker

PubliCV is the open source platform to help Job seekers find their next Employer, and vice versa, _directly_. The core idea is to simplify the job seekeing / recruitment processes by cutting the middlemen out. See: https://publicv.org 

**"PubliCV: one website for each job seeker"** is now a pledge [published](https://pledgeviewer.eu/pledge/initiative/659) on the **Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition** of the **European Commission**.

The source code of the core service is released under the MIT license (see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/publicv-org/publicv/blob/develop/LICENSE) file and the [terms of service](https://publicv.org/legal/terms) for more).
