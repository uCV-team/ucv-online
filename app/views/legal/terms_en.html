        <li>
          The reusable source code is available here: <a href="https://github.com/publicv-org/publicv">https://github.com/publicv-org/publicv</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> You can end this licence for specific content deleting such content from the Services or closing/deleting your account. </p>
      <p> The user profile is hereby referred to as the &ldquo;publiCV&rdquo;. </p>
      <h5> 1.3 The Core Service (free) </h5>
      <p> PubliCV can offer a wide array of services. Among these, the core service hereby defined will always be free and unrestricted (except in the event of abuse). &nbsp; </p>
      <p> The core service is defined as follows: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The user can create a publiCV &nbsp;inclusive of their skills, professional experience, training and professional goals.
        </li>
        <li> A search engine is provided to select publiCVs with the desired attributes. </li>
        <li> Each publiCV provides a form to manually contact one candidate at a time. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The source code of the core service is open source and fully available here under MIT license: <a href="https://github.com/publicv-org/publicv">https://github.com/publicv-org/publicv</a> .
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that the source code other than the one needed to provide the core service could not be open source and/or distributed with a different license.
      </p>
      <h5> 1.4 Business Model </h5>
      <p> The business model of PubliCV, hence the paid services, will be built around the core service, hence, leaving the core service free of charge. An example of paid service built </p>
      <p> &nbsp;around the main one would be the ability to contact many candidates at the same time, provided they are selected by an advanced search criteria, sending the same message to all of them. In &nbsp;this case the need to protect them from spam and other abuses arises. One solution is to offer this kind of service as a paid service, with a reasonable fee. </p>
      <h5>1.5 Benefit Corporation and legal entity</h5>
      <p> As stated at paragraph 1.1, the PubliCV project is currently a joint effort between Corsidia and Bluebash. As such, it does NOT qualify as a legal entity yet. PubliCV will become a stand-alone Company with a distinct legal entity after it becomes a profitable-enough project. </p>
      <p>
        In case PubliCV will satisfy this profitability requirement, it will be established &nbsp;as a Benefit Corporation or &ldquo;B-CORP&rdquo; as defined by the law. &nbsp;Please note that <a href="https://corsidia.com/societa-benefit">Corsidia is already a benefit corporation</a>.
      </p>
      <h4> 2. Obligations </h4>

Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 18. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;Minimum Age&rdquo; means 18 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for PubliCV to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. </p>
      <h5> 2.2 Your Account </h5>
      <p> Users are account holders. You agree to: (1) use a strong password and keep it confidential; (2) follow the law and our list of Dos and Don&rsquo;ts and Professional Community Policies. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. </p>
      <p> As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account. </p>
      <h5> 2.3 Payments </h5>
      <p> As stated on paragraph 1.3 the core service is free of charge. </p>
      <p> If you buy any of our paid Services (&ldquo;Premium Services&rdquo;), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that: </p>
      <p> Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates). </p>
      <p> We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your Services and to use to pay other Services you may buy. </p>
      <p> If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your Premium Services. </p>
      <p> All of your purchases of Services are subject to PubliCV&rsquo;s refund policy. </p>
      <p> We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase. </p>

Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other Users, Guests or others (including off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to PubliCV connections, restricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to notify others of your PubliCV profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections network or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Service or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster. </p>
      <p> We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it with or without notice. </p>
